# Does long term exposure to different climate change scenarios affect copepod thermal limits?

Matthew Sasaki & Mathew Holmes-Hackerd, Rowan Batts, Lisa Piastuch, Hans Dam

This project measures thermal limits for experimental lineages of the copepod *Acartia tonsa*. The lineages were from a factorial experimental design, combining ambient and increased temperature and CO2 values, to simulate four different climate change scenarios (ambient, warming, acidification, and co-occurring warming and acidification). The initial population was collected from Long Island Sound in the summer of 2017, and each lineage has since experienced over 150 generations under their respective conditions. We used a dynamic ramping assay to measure critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of copepods. Data was collected during Fall of 2022.

Data was collected by Rowan Batts, Mathew Holmes-Hackerd, Lisa Piastuch, and Matthew Sasaki. Matthew Sasaki wrote all code to analyze the data.

--- Workflow ---  
This experiment is comprised of multiple replicates (individual heat stress assays). The setup details (how many individuals from each lineage) were randomized, generated by the 00_setup_guide.R script. Temperature data was continuously recorded during the ramping assays, and used in combination with the time that each individual ceased responding to stimuli to measure CTmax in degrees C. Individual lengths were measured after the CTmax assay. These files are integrated via the data_processing.R script, which outputs processed CTmax data.

To replicate these analyses, the entire project folder can be downloaded. By sourcing the 02_controller script, the entire analysis from data processing to visualization and analysis can be replicated.
